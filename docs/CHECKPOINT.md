## What was completed

### This session (April 19) — PAID FLOW FIXED
- **Paid E2E WORKING for the first time in weeks.** 19/19 endpoints returning 200 with real USDC settlements via CDP facilitator. Full SolScout stress run: `TOTAL: 19/19 passed | 0 failed | avg 6034ms`. ~$0.146 USDC revenue landed in agent wallet.
- **Facilitator swap: payai.network → Coinbase CDP** (`https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/platform/v2/x402`). Uses `@coinbase/x402@2.1.0` package; reads `CDP_API_KEY_ID` + `CDP_API_KEY_SECRET` from env.
- **Root cause of broken paid flow (found today):** MPP middleware was registered unconditionally on every invoke route. It ran AFTER our x402 wrapper in the Hono chain and overwrote x402's response with its own 402 challenge (paymentauth.org RFC 7807 format). Clients saw a 402 even for successful x402 payments.
- **Fix:** gated MPP's `chargeHandler` behind `Authorization: Payment` header check. MPP only runs when an MPP credential is genuinely present. Preserves dual-protocol behavior (x402 default, MPP opt-in via explicit header).
- **Stability win:** added graceful fallback around x402ResourceServer.initialize(). If CDP auth fails (bad key, down facilitator), the server logs clearly and keeps MPP + free endpoints running instead of crash-looping Railway.
- **CDP API key scopes required:** Trade + Transfer + Receive + View (empirically — docs are silent). View-only returns 401.
- **CDP facilitator rotates fee payer per request** — no cache issue since challenge and verify use the same snapshot.
- **Automatic bazaar listing:** should appear on x402 bazaar within ~24h now that CDP sees real settlements from us.

### Previous session (April 18)
- **Jupiter Perps shipped — DONE.** Priority 10 complete. Two new paid endpoints live: `perps-market-structure` ($0.012) + `perps-trader-profile` ($0.010). 19 total endpoints now.
  - `@coral-xyz/anchor@0.29.0` installed (downgraded from 0.32; 0.32 expects new IDL format, reference IDLs are 0.29-era)
  - Jupiter Perps + Doves oracle IDLs in `src/idl/`
  - `src/sources/jupiter-perps.ts` — on-chain Anchor account reader: 3 tradable custodies (SOL/BTC/ETH), borrow APR via jump-rate curve, OI from `guaranteedUsd`+`globalShortSizes`, Doves oracle mark prices, positions via `getProgramAccounts` memcmp filter
  - `src/enrichers/perps-analyzer.ts` — market risk flags, headroom, HEALTHY/TILTED/STRESSED; trader classification (scalper/swing/position), PnL totals, leverage/liquidation flags
  - `src/formatters/llm-perps.ts` — readable market + trader briefings
  - `src/entrypoints/perps.ts`, registered in agent.ts + MCP tools + OpenAPI spec + /docs
  - Live tested: SOL $86 / BTC $75.8K / ETH $2.35K, total OI ~$80M, 10-12% APR, json + llm both work
  - **Scaling gotchas** (logged in CLAUDE.md): `targetUtilizationRate` uses RATE_POWER (1e9) NOT BPS_POWER; jump-rate bps values are ANNUALIZED APR, NOT hourly
- **Orbis API listing — 500-char summary drafted** (in chat history, ready to send to founder)

## Next session plan (ACTION ITEMS)

### 1. Verify x402 bazaar listing appeared
- CDP auto-registers paid servers on bazaar within ~24h after first settlement
- Check https://bazaar.x402.org or wherever CDP lists sellers — we should appear
- If not there after 48h, check CDP dashboard / reach out to them

### 2. Orbis API listing
- 500-char summary drafted — ready to send to founder
- Share `docs/listing-profile.md`
- Submit listing

### 3. Real Jupiter Perps trader verify (deferred from April 18)
- `perps-trader-profile` tested against Solana Foundation wallet (no positions) — shape checks pass but we never verified with actual open positions
- Find a trader via Jupiter Perps leaderboard or on-chain `getProgramAccounts` search
- Run paid call, confirm PnL/leverage/flags render correctly with real data

### 4. Remaining roadmap
- **Priority 9 — Smart Money** — `trending-signals`, `smart-money-flow` (2-3 sessions)
- **Priority 11 — Smarter Query** — Multi-step orchestration. Add perps routing ("SOL-PERP funding rate?") (1 session)
- **Priority 12 — Portfolio Tracker** — From temporal snapshots (1 session)
- **Distribution:** mcp.run, Glama, x402 bazaar (community POST + evaluate CDP facilitator switch)

### 4. Perps follow-ups (optional depth)
- Liquidation events — parse tx logs from event authority `37hJBDnntwqhGbK7L6M1bLyvccj4u55CCUiLPdYkiqBN`
- Cross-venue expansion — Adrena, Zeta, Mango next quarter
- Perps-aware orchestration — fold market structure into `due-diligence` when token has perp exposure

### Pending Responses
- **Helius partnership** — Application submitted 2026-04-09, awaiting response
- **tokens.xyz** — Tweeted from @solenrichHQ requesting API access, awaiting response
- **Bags Hackathon** — Submitted, judging pending

## Blockers
- **@solana/kit must stay at 5.5.1** — 6.x causes @solana/errors runtime crash in Bun
- **@coral-xyz/anchor pinned to 0.29.0** — 0.32+ requires new IDL format (address/metadata fields); reference IDLs are v0.29 era. Verified working under Bun 1.2.21.
- **Stripe E2E still untested** — MPP middleware is now correctly gated behind `Authorization: Payment` header. Without a test Stripe card we haven't confirmed end-to-end, but structural routing verified (no-auth requests get x402 challenge, not MPP).

## Key decisions made
- **MPP must be gated behind `Authorization: Payment` header** (2026-04-19) — Hono continues middleware chain after x402 returns a response. MPP registered as unconditional `app.use()` would overwrite x402's result. Always wrap MPP's chargeHandler in a check that calls `next()` when there's no MPP credential.
- **CDP API keys require Trade + Transfer + Receive + View scopes** (2026-04-19) — View-only returns 401 from the facilitator. Docs don't document which scope gates x402 specifically; enabling all four is the safe path.
- **Facilitator: Coinbase CDP, not payai** (2026-04-19) — payai.network's v2 schema drifted from @x402/core 2.6 (expects `accepted` nested in `paymentPayload` vs the SDK's top-level `paymentRequirements`). CDP speaks the current schema and supports Solana mainnet. Bonus: bazaar auto-listing.
- **Anchor pinned to 0.29.0** (2026-04-18) — reference Jupiter Perps IDL format predates Anchor 0.30's new IDL schema. Staying on 0.29 until we're ready to regenerate IDLs (not urgent).
- **Annualized APR interpretation of jump-rate bps** (2026-04-18) — empirically verified: raw `targetRateBps=3500` at 7% utilization produces 12% APR, matching observed Jupiter Perps rates. Rates are annualized, not hourly.
- **Jupiter Perps via Anchor IDL, not REST** (2026-04-15) — No REST API exists for Jupiter Perps. All data lives in on-chain accounts (Pool, Custody, Position). Access via `@coral-xyz/anchor` Program + IDL. Uses borrow fees instead of funding rates.
- **Perps pivot: Jupiter Perps, not Drift** (2026-04-14) — Drift hacked for $285M, API offline, TVL collapsed. Jupiter Perps is now dominant Solana perps DEX.
- **Birdeye with graceful fallback** (2026-04-14) — supplements but never blocks enrichment
- **x402 as default protocol** — MPP only on explicit `Authorization: Payment` header
- **MCP tool parity** — every endpoint gets a matching MCP tool
